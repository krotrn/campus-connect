/**
 * Creates a new product for the authenticated shop owner.
 *
 * This server action validates the provided product data, authenticates the user as a shop owner,
 * and creates a new product associated with their shop. The function expects form data containing
 * product details and returns an appropriate response based on the creation result.
 *
 * @param formData - The form data containing product information
 * @param formData.name - The product name (extracted from form)
 * @param formData.description - The product description (extracted from form)
 * @param formData.price - The product price (extracted from form)
 * @param formData.stock_quantity - The initial stock quantity (extracted from form)
 *
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a response object containing:
 *   - success: boolean indicating if the product was created successfully
 *   - data: the created product object (if successful)
 *   - message: success or error message
 *
 * @throws {Error} When product creation fails due to service errors
 *
 * @see {@link productSchema} for input validation rules
 * @see {@link productServices.createProduct} for the underlying service method
 * @see {@link createSuccessResponse} and {@link createErrorResponse} for response structure
